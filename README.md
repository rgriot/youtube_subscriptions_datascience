# youtube_subscriptions_datascience
My personal youtube subscriptions analysis

This is a data science projects on my personal youtube subscription channels
In this project I used :
 - API requests
 - Natural Language Processing of channel classification and recommandation
 - Data analysis to display the trend of one particular channel
 - Machine learning for view prediction

## Get my YouTube subscription data
I used the YouTube API to get all the data from my subscribed channels
The code used is in `YT_get_data_from_API.ipynb`

The channel data is in `subscribed_channels.csv` and the videos data is in the folder **channels_data**

## My subscriptions analysis
With Natural Language Processing, I analyzed and classified the YouTube channels
The code used is in `YT_subscriptions_analysis.ipynb`

## Single channel analysis
I focused on one channel analysis, such as views, likes and shares trends.
I also tried to predict the views of a video
The code used is in `YT_single_channel_analysis.ipynb`
